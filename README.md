# BePaS - Heuristic Model for a Smart Parking System
Note: This model was forked from https://github.com/DiogoRibeiro7/Identical-parallel-Machine-Scheduling and was mapped to our integer linear problem formulation in our paper A. B. Gorgulu, H. O. Kamali, M. Karakus, E. Guler and S. Uludag, "A Proof of Concept for Blockchain-Enhanced Smart Parking System with SDN: BePaS".
